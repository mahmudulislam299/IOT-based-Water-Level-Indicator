# IOT-based-Water-Level-Indicator

Water tank overflow often leads to the wastage of water. Present electronic device can raise an alarm upon getting the water tank full or to a preset level. This simple ultrasonic sensor based water level indicator circuit is very useful to indicate the water level in a tank. Whenever the tank is filled, user gets alert on particular levels. Here, we have created levels by alarms & we have also created a mobile application to indicate the level of water and one buzzer to indicate full level. When tanks get filled completely we get beep sound from the buzzer. So now we do not have to worry about overflow and water out anymore
